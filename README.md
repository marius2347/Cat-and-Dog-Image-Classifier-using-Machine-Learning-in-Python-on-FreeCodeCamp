<h1> Cat and Dog Image Classifier - ML Python Project</h1>
<br>
<h2>Features</h2>
<li>Correctly classifies images of cats and dogs at least 63% of the time</li>
<li>Create image generators for each of the three image data sets</li>
<li>Rescale the tensors from values between 0 and 255 to values between 0 and 1 to read / decode the images and convert them into floating point tensors</li>
<li>Plot five random training images</li>
<li>Creating more training data from existing training examples by using random transformations</li>
<li>Create a model for the neural network that outputs class probabilities</li>
<li>Use the model to predict whether a brand new image is a cat or a dog</li>
<li>50 test images with a label showing the percentage of "sure" that the image is a cat or a dog</li>
