<h1>Cat and Dog Image Classifier using Machine Learning in Python on FreeCodeCamp</h1>
<br>
<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Correctly classifies images of cats and dogs at least 63% of the time</li>
  <li>Create image generators for each of the three image data sets</li>
  <li>Rescale the tensors from values between 0 and 255 to values between 0 and 1 to read / decode the images and convert them into floating point tensors</li>
  <li>Plot five random training images</li>
  <li>Creating more training data from existing training examples by using random transformations</li>
  <li>Create a model for the neural network that outputs class probabilities</li>
  <li>Use the model to predict whether a brand new image is a cat or a dog</li>
  <li>50 test images with a label showing the percentage of "sure" that the image is a cat or a dog</li>
</ul>
